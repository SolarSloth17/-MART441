What you created 

I created an index.html, readme.md, and script.js. I also created a CSS file since I am used to creating one. In the script.js, I put my three favorite websites, games, and artists. Also, the question-and-answer using prompt() and console.log().  

What the generative AI/someone else created 

The generative AI created a similar outcome to what I created. In the index.html, Ai included a meta charset which I was not familiar with.  

 How would you feel if you relied only on AI-generated output or someone else's work? 

Overall, I don’t like the idea of relying only on AI-generated output for anything. When it comes to AI-generated content, I don’t know how accurate it is, not just for coding but for other things.  

 Whether you could adequately explain the code that was written 

I probably would not be able to adequately explain the code that was written completely. I could explain some of the code in simple detail, but it would be limited to what I know. 

 Whether the final work still feels like your own 

I don’t think the final work still feels like my own. It was very helpful to get a guide on what I should do.
