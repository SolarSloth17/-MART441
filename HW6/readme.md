AI 

This time, AI created something that followed the assignment. Also, I understand the code since it followed the instructions. It added some things that were not in the example that were included like the function createGrid() and the function revealImage(index). One thing that AI doesn’t create is a css. Instead, it put the css part in the html file.  

 

Reflect 

Unlike the last homework assignment, this one was easier going, even though the coding wasn’t working on the site. The example was also not working. Maybe that was the reason I thought the homework was going alright. There was not as much coding as in the last homework, which I liked, because coding is not my greatest strength.
