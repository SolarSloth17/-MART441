Gemini didn’t follow completely what was asked. I have a feeling part of it is the way I worded the question.  

What did you like? 
There wasn’t much I liked about it. If anything, I was confused because it was different than the example that was given. I did like how AI chose a neon color for the background since the story was related to neon. 

What didn’t you like? 
I didn’t like most of what Gemini created. It was missing DOM. Most of the coding was in index.html.  

Discussing your successes, challenges, and how you overcame them.
The most challenging part was coming up with a story. I looked up different types of adventures and picked one. Everything else was successful for me.
