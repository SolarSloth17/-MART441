Gemini didn’t follow completely what was asked. I have a feeling part of it is the way I worded the question.  

What did you like? 
There wasn’t much I liked about it. If anything, I was confused because it was different than the example that was given. I did like how AI chose a neon color for the background since the story was related to neon. 

What didn’t you like? 
I didn’t like most of what Gemini created. It was missing DOM. Most of the coding was in index.html.
