Use Generative AI to create a similar piece, and reflect on the experience

For this assignment, Gemini created something that followed the specific requirements. However, it coded the functions and the if / else if / else and/or switch statements differently from what we were taught. It also thought I was asking it to create a game instead of a story. Overall, I was confused about what it created. Also, it didn’t help me when I was getting stuck on the assignment.

This assignment was a big headache for me. I couldn't figure out what was wrong. One day, I somehow did something right that it worked somewhat; it did some of what was supposed to do on the site. The next day, I went back to square one, where most of the code didn’t work. Nothing I did was working on the site. It didn’t help that I had forgotten what I did the day before. It seemed like only the example that was given worked, and everything else didn’t. AI didn’t help me in any meaningful way. Maybe I just don’t know how to ask it the right questions, but AI does not seem to be helpful to my creativity.

The reason there is an HW5 and an HW(5) is that the first one, I code everything like I would usually, but nothing worked. I made the HW5(2) to see if putting everything in the index.html, like the example, would work. For the most part, it still didn't work, but it was better than the first attempt.
